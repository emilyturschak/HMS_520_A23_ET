# HMS_520_A23_ET
HMS 520 final project

#team members: Emily Turschak

#format: Analyzing an existing dataset 

#overall project goal: use the MICrONS Explorer data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science to determine variations in the thickness of myelination of axons from different cell types in the mouse brain 

#plans and timeline: write code to define "myelination" and quatify the width of myelination, perform this analysis on at least five different cells from at least two different cell-types within this dataset, and visually display these results
