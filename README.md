# HMS_520_A23_ET
HMS 520 final project

#team members: Emily Turschak

#format: Analyzing an existing dataset 

#overall project goal: use the MICrONS Explorer data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science to determine variations in the thickness of myelination of axons from different cell types in the mouse brain 

#plans and timeline: write code to define "myelination" and quatify the width of myelination, perform this analysis on at least five different cells from at least two different cell-types within this dataset, and visually display these results 

#UPDATE
#change of plans: much to my dismay, I was not able to execute the above project proposal. I've explained the situation in a message on Canvas, and am switching my project idea to the following 
#format: create a package or set of functions 

#overall project goal: to create a set of functions that will allow me to determine co-localization from imaging data. For example, if I have an image from a microscope of a cell that has two fluorescently-labeled proteins, I want to be able to tell what percentage of pixels that are labeled with fluorescent stain #1 are also co-labeled with fluorescent stain #2 (ie. what percentage of green pixels are also red? what percentage of red pixels are also green?). Additionally, I want to do this for two different conditions (ie. one image is of a cell from a control group, and one image is of a cell from a scientifically relevant question), and compare the co-localiztion results between the two conditions
